## 2. Project overview

The goal is to **develop an intelligent agent**, documenting the design and implementation steps. The agent solves a routing problem for a local food distribution platform, using the AI techniques covered in the course: informed search, local search and constraint satisfaction.

### Theme: Local food

**Motivation**
- Demand for local food is growing in the EU, but small producers face high logistics costs and price volatility.
- Short supply chains reduce transport emissions and food waste compared to long-distance distribution.
- Fruit and vegetable prices have risen sharply in recent years, squeezing both producers and consumers.
- A platform that connects producers, consumers and logistics can make local distribution efficient and viable.
- **The key challenge is routing:** selecting efficient pickup-and-delivery routes under time-window constraints.

### Business model

A digital platform connecting three types of actors:

| Actor | Role |
|-------|------|
| **Producers** | Small local farms offering fruits, vegetables and other products |
| **Customers** | Place orders and choose a delivery location |
| **Collection centers (warehouses)** | Aggregate products from producers before distribution; operate a fleet of vehicles |

The platform's **routing agent** selects the best pickup-and-delivery routes by:
- Considering pickup locations (producers), drop-off locations (chosen by each customer) and the distances/times between all locations.
- Respecting the time windows in which products are available at the producer and must be delivered to the customer.

## 3. Algorithms applied

| Technique | Application in this project |
|-----------|-----------------------------|
| **Informed search** (Greedy best-first, A\*) | Find efficient pickup-and-delivery routes using a distance/time heuristic. Compared with 2 heuristics. |
| **Local search** (Hill climbing) | Improve an initial routing solution (the Greedy one) by iteratively exploring neighboring route configurations. |
| **Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)** | Model time-window constraints (availability at producers, delivery deadlines at customers) and vehicle capacity as constraints to satisfy. |

## 4. Dataset

A **synthetic dataset**, generated as a set of CSV files (no database engine required). It covers the **Braga district** and **Póvoa de Varzim**.

It contains everything the routing agent needs: producers, collection centers (warehouses), vehicles, customers and delivery locations, customer orders with pickup and delivery time windows, and a distance-and-time table between every pair of routing stops.

Several datasets with the same structure are provided (via Moodle): `tiny`, `small`, and larger ones.

### 4.1 Entities and relationships

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Locality** | Shared geocoded place (parish, municipality, district, coordinates) used by producers, centers and customers |
| **Producer** | Small local producer, located at a Locality, offering one or more Products |
| **Product** | Item offered by a Producer |
| **CollectionCenter** | Warehouse where goods are aggregated; home base for the Vehicles |
| **Vehicle** | Belongs to a CollectionCenter; has a capacity |
| **Customer** | Places CustomerOrders and chooses a DeliveryLocation for each one |
| **DeliveryLocation** | Delivery point chosen by the customer, located at a Locality |
| **CustomerOrder / OrderItem** | One order per customer; each item has an availability window at the producer and a delivery window at the delivery location |
| **Locations** | Derived routing layer built from the coordinates of producers, centers and delivery locations |
| **DistanceMatrix** | Derived routing layer with distance and travel time between every ordered pair of stops |

### 4.2 Orders and time windows

- Each customer order is linked to exactly one delivery location, chosen by the customer.
- Each order line (OrderItem) carries two time windows:
  - `availability_start` / `availability_end`: when the product can be collected at the producer.
  - `delivery_start` / `delivery_end`: when it must arrive at the delivery location.
- These windows are exactly the **constraints the routing agent must satisfy**: pickups cannot happen before a product is available, and deliveries cannot happen after the delivery window closes.

### 4.3 Distance and travel-time matrix

`distance_matrix` gives distance and travel time between every ordered pair of routing stops (producers, collection centers, delivery locations):

- `distance_km`: great-circle distance scaled by a route factor (default **1.3**) to approximate real road distance.
- `duration_min`: distance converted to time using an average road speed (default **45 km/h**).

It is a synthetic approximation, but deterministic and symmetric. It is enough to exercise informed search, local search and CSP time-window constraints without needing a live maps API.
